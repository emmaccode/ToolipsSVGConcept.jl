# ToolipsSVGConcept.jl
" A project which shows SVG interactivity in a template demonstration for creating ToolipsSVG.jl" - What does that mean? [ToolipsSVG.jl](https://github.com/ChifiSource/ToolipsSVG.jl) is a new [Toolips](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Toolips.jl) extension for creating both interactive and non-interactive SVGs. This could branch out into the creation of a lot more really cool software, including but not limited to: visualization tools, video games, and more.
